 Wesleyan University COMP333 HW4

To run: put the contents of the backendbasics folder into htdocs and start servers using XAMPP. Open android studio and start a Pixel 5 API 34 emulator (graders will test using API 31, but I can't seem to access that with Android Studio). Open a terminal tab in the HW4 folder and run "npx expo start" (after you've downloaded the relevant packages SPECIFY WHICH PACKAGES). Then type 'a' to run the app in the emulator.
